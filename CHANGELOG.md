    - Infrastructure:
      - Lua 5.1 support is removed due to lack of support in sol2 https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2/issues/302
      - Fixed pkg-config version of OSRM
      - Removed `.osrm.core` file since CoreCH is deprecated now.
    - Tools:
      - Because of boost/program_options#32 with boost 1.65+ we needed to change the behavior of the following flags to not accept `={true|false}` anymore:
        - `--use-locations-cache=false` becomes `--disable-location-cache`
        - `--parse-conditional-restrictions=true` becomes `--parse-conditional-restrictions`
        - The deprecated options `--use-level-cache` and `--generate-edge-lookup`
    - Bugfixes:
      - Fixed #4348: Some cases of sliproads pre-processing were broken
      - Fixed #4331: Correctly compute left/right modifiers of forks in case the fork is curved.
      - Fixed #4472: Correctly count the number of lanes using the delimter in `turn:lanes` tag.
      - Fixed #4214: Multiple runs of `osrm-partition` lead to crash.
      - Fixed #4348: Fix assorted problems around slip roads.

      - MLD uses a unidirectional Dijkstra for 1-to-N and N-to-1 matrices which yields speedup.

# 5.12.0
  - Changes from 5.11:
    - Guidance
      - now announcing turning onto oneways at the end of a road (e.g. onto dual carriageways)
      - Adds new instruction types at the exit of roundabouts and rotaries `exit roundabout` and `exit rotary`.
    - HTTP:
      - New query parameter for route/table/match/trip plugings:
        `exclude=` that can be used to exclude certain classes (e.g. exclude=motorway, exclude=toll).
        This is configurable in the profile.
    - NodeJS:
      - New query option `exclude` for the route/table/match/trip plugins. (e.g. `exclude: ["motorway", "toll"]`)
    - Profile:
      - New property for profile table: `excludable` that can be used to configure which classes are excludable at query time.
      - New optional property for profile table: `classes` that allows you to specify which classes you expect to be used.
        We recommend this for better error messages around classes, otherwise the possible class names are infered automatically.
    - Traffic:
      - If traffic data files contain an empty 4th column, they will update edge durations but not modify the edge weight.  This is useful for
        updating ETAs returned, without changing route selection (for example, in a distance-based profile with traffic data loaded).
    - Infrastructure:
      - New file `.osrm.cell_metrics` created by `osrm-customize`.
    - Debug tiles:
      - Added new properties `type` and `modifier` to `turns` layer, useful for viewing guidance calculated turn types on the map

    - Infrastructure
      - Refactor datafacade to make implementing additional DataFacades simpler
    - Bugfixes
      - API docs are now buildable again

      - Various MSVC++ build environment fixes
      - Avoid a bug that crashes GCC6
      - Re-include .npmignore to slim down published modules
      - Fix a pre-processing bug where incorrect directions could be issued when two turns would have similar instructions and we tried to give them distinct values (https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/pull/4375)
      - The entry bearing for correct the cardinality of a direction value (https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/pull/4353

      - New required `setup()` function that must return a configuration hash. Storing configuration in globals is deprecated.
      - Passes the config hash returned in `setup()` as an argument to `process_node/way/segment/turn`.
      - Properties are now set in `.properties` in the config hash returend by setup().
      - initialize raster sources in `setup()` instead of in a separate callback.
      - Renames the `sources` helper to `raster`.
      - Renames `way_functions` to `process_way` (same for node, segment and turn).
      - Removes `get_restrictions()`. Instead set `.restrictions` in the config hash in `setup()`.
      - Removes `get_name_suffix_list()`. Instead set `.suffix_list` in the config hash in `setup()`.
      - Renames `Handlers` to `WayHandlers`.
      - Pass functions instead of strings to `WayHandlers.run()`, so it's possible to mix in your own functions.
      - Reorders arguments to `WayHandlers` functions to match `process_way()`.
      - Profiles must return a hash of profile functions. This makes it easier for profiles to include each other.
      - Guidance: add support for throughabouts
    - Bugfixes
      - Properly save/retrieve datasource annotations for road segments ([#4346](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/4346)

    - API:
      - Exposes `alternatives=Number` parameter overload in addition to the boolean flag.
      - Support for exits numbers and names. New member `exits` in `RouteStep`, based on `junction:ref` on ways

    - Profiles:
      - `result.exits` allows you to set a way's exit numbers and names, see [`junction:ref`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/junction_details)
      - `ExtractionWay` now as new property `forward_classes` and `backward_classes` that can set in the `way_function`.
         The maximum number of classes is 8.
      - We now respect the `construction` tag. If the `construction` tag value is not on our whitelist (`minor`, `widening`, `no`) we will exclude the road.
    - Node.js Bindings:
      - Exposes `alternatives=Number` parameter overload in addition to the boolean flag
      - Expose `EngineConfig` options in the node bindings
    - Tools:
      - Exposes engine limit on number of alternatives to generate `--max-alternatives` in `osrm-routed` (3 by default)
    - Infrastructure
      - STXXL is not required to build OSRM and is an optional dependency for back-compatibility (ENABLE_STXXL=On)
      - OpenMP is only required when the optional STXXL dependency is used
    - Bug fixes:
      - #4278: Remove superflous continious instruction on a motorway.

# 5.8.0
  - Changes from 5.7
    - API:
      - polyline6 support in request string
      - new parameter `approaches` for `route`, `table`, `trip` and `nearest` requests.  This parameter keep waypoints on the curb side.
        'approaches' accepts both 'curb' and 'unrestricted' values.
        Note : the curb side depend on the `ProfileProperties::left_hand_driving`, it's a global property set once by the profile. If you are working with a planet dataset, the api will be wrong in some countries, and right in others.
    - NodeJs Bindings
      - new parameter `approaches` for `route`, `table`, `trip` and `nearest` requests.
    - Tools
      - `osrm-partition` now ensures it is called before `osrm-contract` and removes inconsitent .hsgr files automatically.
    - Features
      - Added conditional restriction support with `parse-conditional-restrictions=true|false` to osrm-extract. This option saves conditional turn restrictions to the .restrictions file for parsing by contract later. Added `parse-conditionals-from-now=utc time stamp` and `--time-zone-file=/path/to/file`  to osrm-contract
      - Command-line tools (osrm-extract, osrm-contract, osrm-routed, etc) now return error codes and legible error messages for common problem scenarios, rather than ugly C++ crashes
      - Speed up pre-processing by only running the Lua `node_function` for nodes that have tags.  Cuts OSM file parsing time in half.
      - osrm-extract now performs generation of edge-expanded-edges using all available CPUs, which should make osrm-extract significantly faster on multi-CPU machines
    - Files
      - .osrm.nodes file was renamed to .nbg_nodes and .ebg_nodes was added
    - Guidance
      - #4075 Changed counting of exits on service roundabouts
    - Debug Tiles

    - Bugfixes
      - Fixed a copy/paste issue assigning wrong directions in similar turns (left over right)
      - #4074: fixed a bug that would announce entering highway ramps as u-turns
      - #4122: osrm-routed/libosrm should throw exception when a dataset incompatible with the requested algorithm is loaded
      - Avoid collapsing u-turns into combined turn instructions

# 5.7.1
    - Bugfixes
      - #4030 Roundabout edge-case crashes post-processing

# 5.7.0
  - Changes from 5.6
    - Algorithm:
      - OSRM object has new option `algorithm` that allows the selection of a routing algorithm.
      - New experimental algorithm: Multi-Level Dijkstra with new toolchain:
        - Allows for fast metric updates in below a minute on continental sized networks (osrm-customize)
        - Plugins supported: `match` and `route`
        - Quickstart: `osrm-extract data.osm.pbf`, `osrm-partition data.osrm`, `osrm-customize data.osrm`, `osrm-routed --algorithm=MLD data.osrm`
    - NodeJs Bindings
      - Merged https://github.com/Project-OSRM/node-osrm into repository. Build via `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_NODE_BINDINGS=On -DENABLE_MASON=On`.
      - `OSRM` object has new option `algorihtm="CH","CoreCH","MLD"`
    - Internals
      - Shared memory notification via conditional variables on Linux or semaphore queue on OS X and Windows with a limit of 128 OSRM Engine instances
    - Files
      - .osrm.datasource_index file was removed. Data is now part of .osrm.geometries.
      - .osrm.edge_lookup was removed. The option `--generate-edge-lookup` does nothing now.
      - `osrm-contract` does not depend on the `.osrm.fileIndex` file anymore
      - `osrm-extract` creates new file `.osrm.cnbg` and `.cnbg_to_ebg`
      - `osrm-partition` creates new file `.osrm.partition` and `.osrm.cells`
      - `osrm-customize` creates new file `.osrm.mldgr`
    - Profiles
      - Added `force_split_edges` flag to global properties. True value guarantees that segment_function will be called for all segments, but also could double memory consumption
    - Map Matching:
      - new option `gaps=split|ignore` to enable/disbale track splitting
      - new option `tidy=true|false` to simplify traces automatically

    - Infrastructure
      - Support building rpm packages.
    - Guidance
      - No longer emitting turns on ferries, if a ferry should use multiple docking locations
    - Profiles
      - Removed the `./profile.lua -> ./profiles/car.lua` symlink. Use specific profiles from the `profiles` directory.
      - `properties` object has a new `weight_name` field, default value is "duration"
      - `properties` object has a new `weight_precision` field that specifies a decimal precision of edge weights, default value 1
      - In `way_function` the filed `forward_rate` and `backward_rate` of `ExtractionWay` can now be set.
        They have the same interpretation for the way weight as `forward_speed` and `backward_speed` for the edge duration.
        The unit of rate is meters per weight unit, so higher values will be prefered during routing.
      - `turn_function` now does not return an integer but takes in a `ExtractionTurn` object and can modify the `weight` and `duration` fields
      - `segment_function` now takes in a `ExtractionSegment` object and can modify `weight` and `duration` fields
      - `properties.uturn_penalty` is deprecated. Set it in the `turn_function`. The turn type is exposed as `ExtractionTurn::direction_modifier`.
      - `properties.traffic_light_penalty` is deprecated. Traffic light penalties now need to be set over in the turn function.
         Each turn with a traffic light is marked with `ExtractionTurn::has_traffic_light = true`.
      - Renamed the helper file `profiles/lib/directional.lua` to `profiles/lib/tags.lua` since it now provides more general tags parsing utility functions.
      - The car and foot profiles now depend on the helper file `profiles/lib/handlers.lua`.
    - Infrastructure
      - Disabled link-time optimized (LTO) builds by default. Enable by passing `-DENABLE_LTO=ON` to `cmake` if you need the performance and know what you are doing.
      - Datafile versioning is now based on OSRM semver values, rather than source code checksums.
        Datafiles are compatible between patch levels, but incompatible between minor version or higher bumps.
      - libOSRM now creates an own watcher thread then used in shared memory mode to listen for data updates
    - Tools:
      - Added osrm-extract-conditionals tool for checking conditional values in OSM data
    - Trip Plugin
      - Added a new feature that finds the optimal route given a list of waypoints, a source and a destination. This does not return a roundtrip and instead returns a one way optimal route from the fixed source to the destination points.

# 5.5.1
  - Changes from 5.5.0
    - API:

      - `car.lua` now depends on lib/set.lua and lib/sequence.lua
      - `restrictions` is now used for namespaced restrictions and restriction exceptions (e.g. `restriction:motorcar=` as well as `except=motorcar`)
      - replaced lhs/rhs profiles by using test defined profiles
      - Handle `oneway=alternating` (routed over with penalty) separately from `oneway=reversible` (not routed over due to time dependence)
      - Handle `destination:forward`, `destination:backward`, `destination:ref:forward`, `destination:ref:backward` tags
      - Properly handle destinations on `oneway=-1` roads
    - Guidance

    - Debug Tiles
      - Added support for turn penalties
    - Internals
      - Internal/Shared memory datafacades now share common memory layout and data loading code
