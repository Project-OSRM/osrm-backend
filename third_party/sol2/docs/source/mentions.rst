First off, feel free to `tell me about your uses!`_

Okay, so the features don't convince you, the documentation doesn't convince you, you want to see what *other* people think about Sol? Well, aside from the well-wishes that come through in the issue tracker, here's a few things floating around about sol2 that I occasionally get pinged about:

`eevee`_ demonstrating the sheer code reduction by using sol2:

Are you using sol2 for something neat? Want it to be featured here or think it's unfair that ThePhD hasn't found it yet? Well, drop an issue in the repo or send an e-mail!
