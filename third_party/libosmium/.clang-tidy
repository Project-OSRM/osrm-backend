#
#  For a list of check options, see:
#  http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html
#
#  Disabled checks:
#
#  android-cloexec-*
#    O_CLOEXEC isn't available on Windows making this non-portable.
#
#  cert-dcl21-cpp
#    It is unclear whether this is still a good recommendation in modern C++.
#
#  cert-err58-cpp
#    Used in several singelton factory functions. I don't know of a better
#    way to do this and it is rather unlikely that this will be a problem.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory
#    Don't want to add dependency on gsl library.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-constant-array-index
#    Is needed for low-level code.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-const-cast
#    When you need it, you need it.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do reinterpret-casts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast
#    This is needed and totally okay if we are sure about the types.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
#    We need some of these functions at least and for some functions it isn't
#    even clear that those are vararg functions.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference, and we can't change the interfaces
#    now anyways.
#
#  hicpp-invalid-access-moved
#    Creates false positives.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Alias for cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay.
#
#  hicpp-no-assembler
#    Reports are from macros we don't have any control over.
#
#  hicpp-vararg
#    Too strict, sometimes calling vararg functions is necessary.
#
#  misc-macro-parentheses
#    False positive in the only place where it reports something and
#    disabling locally doesn't work.
#
#  misc-unused-parameters
#    Can't be fixed, because then Doxygen will complain. (In file
#    include/osmium/area/problem_reporter.hpp).
#
#  modernize-make-unique
#    This is a C++11 library and C++ doesn't have std::make_unique.
#
#  modernize-raw-string-literal
#    Readability isn't that much better, arguably worse because of the new
#    syntax.
#
#  readability-avoid-const-params-in-decls
#    This is header only library, so the declaration and implementation are
#    often the same and we want to have the const in implementations.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-cast
#    Old name for readability-implicit-bool-conversion.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
