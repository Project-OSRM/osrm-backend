         * The Collector class collects members of a relation. This is a
         * generic base class that can be used to assemble all kinds of
         * relations. It has numerous hooks you can implement in derived
         * classes to customize its behaviour.
         *
         * The collector provides two handlers (HandlerPass1 and HandlerPass2)
         * for a first and second pass through an input file, respectively. In
         * the first pass all relations we are interested in are stored in
         * RelationMeta objects in the m_relations vector. All members we are
         * interested in are stored in MemberMeta objects in the m_member_meta
         * vectors. The MemberMeta objects also store the information where the
         * relations containing those members are to be found.
         *
         * Later the m_member_meta vectors are sorted according to the member
         * ids so that a binary search (with std::equal_range) can be used in
         * the second pass to find the parent relations for each node, way, or
         * relation coming along. The member objects are stored together with
         * their relation and once a relation is complete the
         * complete_relation() method is called which you must overwrite in a
         * derived class of Collector.
         *
         * @tparam TCollector Derived class of this class.
         * @tparam TNodes Are we interested in member nodes?
         * @tparam TWays Are we interested in member ways?
         * @tparam TRelations Are we interested in member relations?
         * @pre The Ids of all objects must be unique in the input data.
