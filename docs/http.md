# OSRM HTTP server

Built-in HTTP server is a basic HTTP/1.0 server that supports 'keep-alive' extension. Persistent connections are limited to 512 requests per
connection and allow no more then 5 seconds between requests.

## General options

All OSRM HTTP requests use a common structure.

The following syntax applies to all services, except as noted.

### Requests

```endpoint
GET /{service}/{version}/{profile}/{coordinates}[.{format}]?option=value&option=value
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service` | One of the following values: [`route`](#route-service), [`nearest`](#nearest-service), [`table`](#table-service), [`match`](#match-service), [`trip`](#trip-service), [`tile`](#tile-service) |
| `version` | Version of the protocol implemented by the service. `v1` for all OSRM 5.x installations |
| `profile` | Mode of transportation, is determined statically by the Lua profile that is used to prepare the data using `osrm-extract`. Typically `car`, `bike` or `foot` if using one of the supplied profiles. |
| `coordinates`| String of format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}[;{longitude},{latitude} ...]` or `polyline({polyline}) or polyline6({polyline6})`. |
| `format`| `json` or `flatbuffers`. This parameter is optional and defaults to `json`. |

Passing any `option=value` is optional. `polyline` follows Google's polyline format with precision 5 by default and can be generated using [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyline).

To pass parameters to each location some options support an array like encoding:

**Request options**

Where the elements follow the following format:

| Element    | Values                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

|class       |A class name determined by the profile or `none`.       |

```
{option}={element};{element}[;{element} ... ]
```

The number of elements must match exactly the number of locations (except for `generate_hints` and `exclude`). If you don't want to pass a value but instead use the default you can pass an empty `element`.

Example: 2nd location use the default value for `option`:

```
{option}={element};;{element}
```

#### Example Requests

```curl
# Query on Berlin with three coordinates:
curl 'http://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.397634,52.529407;13.428555,52.523219?overview=false'

```

### Responses

#### Code

Every response object has a `code` property containing one of the strings below or a service dependent code:

| Type              | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ok`              | Request could be processed as expected.                                          |
| `InvalidUrl`      | URL string is invalid.                                                           |
| `InvalidService`  | Service name is invalid.                                                         |
| `InvalidVersion`  | Version is not found.                                                            |
| `InvalidOptions`  | Options are invalid.                                                             |
| `InvalidQuery`    | The query string is synctactically malformed.                                    |
| `InvalidValue`    | The successfully parsed query parameters are invalid.                            |
| `NoSegment`       | One of the supplied input coordinates could not snap to street segment.          |
| `TooBig`          | The request size violates one of the service specific request size restrictions. |

- `message` is a **optional** human-readable error message. All other status types are service dependent.
- In case of an error the HTTP status code will be `400`. Otherwise the HTTP status code will be `200` and `code` will be `Ok`.

#### Data version

Every response object has a `data_version` propetry containing timestamp from the original OpenStreetMap file. This field is optional. It can be ommited if data_version parametr was not set on osrm-extract stage or OSM file has not `osmosis_replication_timestamp` section.

#### Example response

```json
{
"code": "Ok",
"message": "Everything worked",
"data_version": "2017-11-17T21:43:02Z"
}
```


## Services

### Nearest service

Snaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest `n` matches.

```endpoint
GET http://{server}/nearest/v1/{profile}/{coordinates}.json?number={number}
```

Where `coordinates` only supports a single `{longitude},{latitude}` entry.

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                        |Description                                         |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|number      |`integer >= 1` (default `1`)  |Number of nearest segments that should be returned. |

As `waypoints` is a single thing, returned byt that service, using it with option `skip_waypoints` set to `true` is quite useless, but still
possible. In that case only `code` field will be returned. 

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `waypoints` array of `Waypoint` objects sorted by distance to the input coordinate. Each object has at least the following additional properties:
  - `nodes`: Array of OpenStreetMap node ids.

#### Example Requests

```curl
# Querying nearest three snapped locations of `13.388860,52.517037` with a bearing between `20° - 340°`.
curl 'http://router.project-osrm.org/nearest/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037?number=3&bearings=0,20'
```

         ],
      }
   ],
   "code" : "Ok"
}
```

### Route service

Finds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.

```endpoint
GET /route/v1/{profile}/{coordinates}?alternatives={true|false|number}&steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={full|simplified|false}&annotations={true|false}
```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                       |Description                                                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|alternatives|`true`, `false` (default), or Number         |Search for alternative routes. Passing a number `alternatives=n` searches for up to `n` alternative routes.\*                            |
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                    |Returned route steps for each route leg                                        |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed`  |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.      |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson` |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)              |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`      |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|
|continue\_straight |`default` (default), `true`, `false`  |Forces the route to keep going straight at waypoints constraining uturns there even if it would be faster. Default value depends on the profile. |
|waypoints   | `{index};{index};{index}...`                |Treats input coordinates indicated by given indices as waypoints in returned Match object. Default is to treat all input coordinates as waypoints.    |

\* Please note that even if alternative routes are requested, a result cannot be guaranteed.

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `waypoints`: Array of `Waypoint` objects representing all waypoints in order:
- `routes`: An array of `Route` objects, ordered by descending recommendation rank.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type              | Description     |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `NoRoute`         | No route found. |

All other properties might be undefined.

#### Example Request

```curl
# Query on Berlin with three coordinates and no overview geometry returned:
curl 'http://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.397634,52.529407;13.428555,52.523219?overview=false'
```

### Table service

Computes the duration of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates. Returns the durations or distances or both between the coordinate pairs. Note that the distances are not the shortest distance between two coordinates, but rather the distances of the fastest routes. Duration is in seconds and distances is in meters.

```endpoint
GET /table/v1/{profile}/{coordinates}?{sources}=[{elem}...];&{destinations}=[{elem}...]&annotations={duration|distance|duration,distance}
```

**Options**

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                            |Description                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|sources     |`{index};{index}[;{index} ...]` or `all` (default)|Use location with given index as source.     |
|destinations|`{index};{index}[;{index} ...]` or `all` (default)|Use location with given index as destination.|
|annotations |`duration` (default), `distance`, or `duration,distance`|Return the requested table or tables in response. |
|fallback_speed|`double > 0`| If no route found between a source/destination pair, calculate the as-the-crow-flies distance, then use this speed to estimate duration.|
|fallback_coordinate|`input` (default), or `snapped`| When using a `fallback_speed`, use the user-supplied coordinate (`input`), or the snapped location (`snapped`) for calculating distances.|
|scale_factor|`double > 0`| Use in conjunction with `annotations=durations`. Scales the table `duration` values by this number.|

Unlike other array encoded options, the length of `sources` and `destinations` can be **smaller or equal**
to number of input locations;

With `skip_waypoints` set to `true`, both `sources` and `destinations` arrays will be skipped.

**Example:**

```
sources=0;5;7&destinations=5;1;4;2;3;6
```

|Element     |Values                       |
|------------|-----------------------------|
|index       |`0 <= integer < #locations`  |

#### Example Request

```

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `durations` array of arrays that stores the matrix in row-major order. `durations[i][j]` gives the travel time from
  the i-th source to the j-th destination. Values are given in seconds. Can be `null` if no route between `i` and `j` can be found.
- `distances` array of arrays that stores the matrix in row-major order. `distances[i][j]` gives the travel distance from
  the i-th source to the j-th destination. Values are given in meters. Can be `null` if no route between `i` and `j` can be found.
- `sources` array of `Waypoint` objects describing all sources in order
- `destinations` array of `Waypoint` objects describing all destinations in order
- `fallback_speed_cells` (optional) array of arrays containing `i,j` pairs indicating which cells contain estimated values based on `fallback_speed`.  Will be absent if `fallback_speed` is not used.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type             | Description     |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `NoTable`        | No route found. |
| `NotImplemented`  | This request is not supported |

All other properties might be undefined.

### Match service

Map matching matches/snaps given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way.
Please note the request might result multiple sub-traces. Large jumps in the timestamps (> 60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found.
The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they can not be matched successfully.

```endpoint
GET /match/v1/{profile}/{coordinates}?steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={simplified|full|false}&annotations={true|false}
```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                          |Description                                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Returned route steps for each route                                                       |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson`    |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)                         |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed`  |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.                 |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`         |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|
|timestamps  |`{timestamp};{timestamp}[;{timestamp} ...]`     |Timestamps for the input locations in seconds since UNIX epoch. Timestamps need to be monotonically increasing. |
|radiuses    |`{radius};{radius}[;{radius} ...]`              |Standard deviation of GPS precision used for map matching. If applicable use GPS accuracy.|
|gaps        |`split` (default), `ignore`                     |Allows the input track splitting based on huge timestamp gaps between points.             |
|tidy        |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Allows the input track modification to obtain better matching quality for noisy tracks.   |
|waypoints   | `{index};{index};{index}...`                   |Treats input coordinates indicated by given indices as waypoints in returned Match object. Default is to treat all input coordinates as waypoints.    |

|Parameter   |Values                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
|timestamp   |`integer` seconds since UNIX epoch |
|radius      |`double >= 0` (default 5m)         |

The radius for each point should be the standard error of the location measured in meters from the true location.
Use `Location.getAccuracy()` on Android or `CLLocation.horizontalAccuracy` on iOS.
This value is used to determine which points should be considered as candidates (larger radius means more candidates) and how likely each candidate is (larger radius means far-away candidates are penalized less).
The area to search is chosen such that the correct candidate should be considered 99.9% of the time (for more details see [this ticket](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/pull/3184)).

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `tracepoints`: Array of `Waypoint` objects representing all points of the trace in order.
  If the trace point was ommited by map matching because it is an outlier, the entry will be `null`.
  Each `Waypoint` object has the following additional properties:
  - `matchings_index`: Index to the `Route` object in `matchings` the sub-trace was matched to.
  - `waypoint_index`: Index of the waypoint inside the matched route.
  - `alternatives_count`: Number of probable alternative matchings for this trace point. A value of zero indicate that this point was matched unambiguously. Split the trace at these points for incremental map matching.
- `matchings`: An array of `Route` objects that assemble the trace. Each `Route` object has the following additional properties:
  - `confidence`: Confidence of the matching. `float` value between 0 and 1. 1 is very confident that the matching is correct.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type              | Description         |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `NoMatch`         | No matchings found. |

All other properties might be undefined.

### Trip service

The trip plugin solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic (farthest-insertion algorithm) for 10 or more waypoints and uses brute force for less than 10 waypoints.
The returned path does not have to be the fastest path. As TSP is NP-hard it only returns an approximation.
Note that all input coordinates have to be connected for the trip service to work.

```endpoint
GET /trip/v1/{profile}/{coordinates}?roundtrip={true|false}&source{any|first}&destination{any|last}&steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={simplified|full|false}&annotations={true|false}'
```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                          |Description                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|roundtrip   |`true` (default), `false`                       |Returned route is a roundtrip (route returns to first location)            |
|source      |`any` (default), `first`                        |Returned route starts at `any` or `first` coordinate                       |
|destination |`any` (default), `last`                         |Returned route ends at `any` or `last` coordinate                          |
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Returned route instructions for each trip                                  |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed` |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.  |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson`    |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)          |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`         |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|

**Fixing Start and End Points**

It is possible to explicitely set the start or end coordinate of the trip.
When source is set to `first`, the first coordinate is used as start coordinate of the trip in the output. When destination is set to `last`, the last coordinate will be used as destination of the trip in the returned output. If you specify `any`, any of the coordinates can be used as the first or last coordinate in the output.

However, if `source=any&destination=any` the returned round-trip will still start at the first input coordinate by default.

Currently, not all combinations of `roundtrip`, `source` and `destination` are supported.
Right now, the following combinations are possible:

| roundtrip | source | destination | supported |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| true | first | last | **yes** |
| true | first | any | **yes** |
| true | any | last | **yes** |
| true | any | any | **yes** |
| false | first | last | **yes** |
| false | first | any | no |
| false | any | last | no |
| false | any | any | no |

  - `trips_index`: Index to `trips` of the sub-trip the point was matched to.
  - `waypoint_index`: Index of the point in the trip.
- `trips`: An array of `Route` objects that assemble the trace.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

|-------------------|---------------------|
| `NoTrips`         | No trips found because input coordinates are not connected.|
| `NotImplemented`  | This request is not supported |

All other properties might be undefined.

### Tile service

This service generates [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/) that can be viewed with a vector-tile capable slippy-map viewer.  The tiles contain road geometries and metadata that can be used to examine the routing graph.  The tiles are generated directly from the data in-memory, so are in sync with actual routing results, and let you examine which roads are actually routable, and what weights they have applied.

```endpoint
GET /tile/v1/{profile}/tile({x},{y},{zoom}).mvt
```

The `x`, `y`, and `zoom` values are the same as described at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames, and are supported by vector tile viewers like [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

#### Example request

```curl
# This fetches a Z=13 tile for downtown San Francisco:
curl 'http://router.project-osrm.org/tile/v1/car/tile(1310,3166,13).mvt'
```

#### Example response

> ![example rendered tile](images/example-tile-response.png)
> http://map.project-osrm.org/debug/#14.33/52.5212/13.3919

The response object is either a binary encoded blob with a `Content-Type` of `application/x-protobuf`, or a `404` error.  Note that OSRM is hard-coded to only return tiles from zoom level 12 and higher (to avoid accidentally returning extremely large vector tiles).

Vector tiles contain two layers:

`speeds` layer:

| Property     | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `speed`      | `integer` | the speed on that road segment, in km/h  |
| `is_small`   | `boolean` | whether this segment belongs to a small (< 1000 node) [strongly connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) |
| `datasource` | `string`  | the source for the speed value (normally `lua profile` unless you're using the [traffic update feature](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic), in which case it contains the stem of the filename that supplied the speed value for this segment |
| `duration`   | `float`   | how long this segment takes to traverse, in seconds.  This value is to calculate the total route ETA. |
| `weight  `   | `integer` | how long this segment takes to traverse, in units (may differ from `duration` when artificial biasing is applied in the Lua profiles).  ACTUAL ROUTING USES THIS VALUE. |
| `name`       | `string`  | the name of the road this segment belongs to |
| `rate`       | `float`   | the value of `length/weight` - analagous to `speed`, but using the `weight` value rather than `duration`, rounded to the nearest integer |
| `is_startpoint` | `boolean` | whether this segment can be used as a start/endpoint for routes |

`turns` layer:

| Property     | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `bearing_in` | `integer` | the absolute bearing that approaches the intersection.  -180 to +180, 0 = North, 90 = East |
| `turn_angle` | `integer` | the angle of the turn, relative to the `bearing_in`.  -180 to +180, 0 = straight ahead, 90 = 90-degrees to the right |
| `cost`       | `float`   | the time we think it takes to make that turn, in seconds.  May be negative, depending on how the data model is constructed (some turns get a "bonus"). |
| `weight`     | `float`   | the weight we think it takes to make that turn.  May be negative, depending on how the data model is constructed (some turns get a "bonus"). ACTUAL ROUTING USES THIS VALUE |
| `type`       | `string`  | the type of this turn - values like `turn`, `continue`, etc.  See the `StepManeuver` for a partial list, this field also exposes internal turn types that are never returned with an API response |
| `modifier`   | `string`  | the direction modifier of the turn (`left`, `sharp left`, etc) |

- `bearing_before`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver.  Range 0-359.
- `bearing_after`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver.  Range 0-359.
- `type` A string indicating the type of maneuver. **new identifiers might be introduced without API change**
   Types  unknown to the client should be handled like the `turn` type, the existence of correct `modifier` values is guranteed.

| `type`           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `turn`           | a basic turn into direction of the `modifier`                |
| `new name`       | no turn is taken/possible, but the road name changes. The road can take a turn itself, following `modifier`.                  |
| `depart`         | indicates the departure of the leg                           |
| `arrive`         | indicates the destination of the leg                         |
| `merge`          | merge onto a street (e.g. getting on the highway from a ramp, the `modifier specifies the direction of the merge`) |
| `ramp`           | **Deprecated**. Replaced by `on_ramp` and `off_ramp`.        |
| `on ramp`        | take a ramp to enter a highway (direction given my `modifier`) |
| `off ramp`       | take a ramp to exit a highway (direction given my `modifier`)  |
| `fork`           | take the left/right side at a fork depending on `modifier`   |
| `end of road`    | road ends in a T intersection turn in direction of `modifier`|
| `use lane`       | **Deprecated** replaced by lanes on all intersection entries |
| `continue`       | Turn in direction of `modifier` to stay on the same road     |
| `roundabout`     | traverse roundabout, if the route leaves the roundabout there will be an additional property `exit` for exit counting. The modifier specifies the direction of entering the roundabout. |
| `rotary`         | a traffic circle. While very similar to a larger version of a roundabout, it does not necessarily follow roundabout rules for right of way. It can offer `rotary_name` and/or `rotary_pronunciation` parameters (located in the RouteStep object) in addition to the `exit` parameter (located on the StepManeuver object).  |
| `roundabout turn`| Describes a turn at a small roundabout that should be treated as normal turn. The `modifier` indicates the turn direciton. Example instruction: `At the roundabout turn left`. |
| `notification`   | not an actual turn but a change in the driving conditions. For example the travel mode or classes. If the road takes a turn itself, the `modifier` describes the direction |
| `exit roundabout`| Describes a maneuver exiting a roundabout (usually preceeded by a `roundabout` instruction) |
| `exit rotary`    | Describes the maneuver exiting a rotary (large named roundabout) |

  Please note that even though there are `new name` and `notification` instructions, the `mode` and `name` can change
  between all instructions. They only offer a fallback in case nothing else is to report.

- `modifier` An optional `string` indicating the direction change of the maneuver.

| `modifier`        | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `uturn`           | indicates  reversal of direction          |
| `sharp right`     | a sharp right turn                        |
| `right`           | a normal turn to the right                |
| `slight right`    | a slight turn to the right                |
| `straight`        | no relevant change in direction           |
| `slight left`     | a slight turn to the left                 |
| `left`            | a normal turn to the left                 |
| `sharp left`      | a sharp turn to the left                  |

  The list of turns without a modifier is limited to: `depart/arrive`. If the source/target location is close enough to the `depart/arrive` location, no modifier will be given.

  The meaning depends on the `type` property.

| `type`                 | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `turn`                 | `modifier` indicates the change in direction accomplished through the turn                                                |
| `depart`/`arrive`      | `modifier` indicates the position of departure point and arrival point in relation to the current direction of travel      |

- `exit` An optional `integer` indicating number of the exit to take. The property exists for the `roundabout` / `rotary` property:
  Number of the roundabout exit to take. If exit is `undefined` the destination is on the roundabout.


New properties (potentially depending on `type`) may be introduced in the future without an API version change.

### Lane object

A `Lane` represents a turn lane at the corresponding turn location.

**Properties**

- `indications`: a indication (e.g. marking on the road) specifying the turn lane. A road can have multiple indications (e.g. an arrow pointing straight and left). The indications are given in an array, each containing one of the following types. Further indications might be added on without an API version change.

| `value`                | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`                 | No dedicated indication is shown.                                                                                         |
| `uturn`                | An indication signaling the possibility to reverse (i.e. fully bend arrow).                                               |
| `sharp right`          | An indication indicating a sharp right turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                   |
| `right`                | An indication indicating a right turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                  |
| `slight right`         | An indication indicating a slight right turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                  |
| `straight`             | No dedicated indication is shown (i.e. straight arrow).                                                                   |
| `slight left`          | An indication indicating a slight left turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                   |
| `left`                 | An indication indicating a left turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                   |
| `sharp left`           | An indication indicating a sharp left turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                    |

- `valid`: a boolean flag indicating whether the lane is a valid choice in the current maneuver

#### Example

```json
{
    "indications": ["left", "straight"],
    "valid": false
}
 ```

### Intersection object

An intersection gives a full representation of any cross-way the path passes bay. For every step, the very first intersection (`intersections[0]`) corresponds to the
location of the StepManeuver. Further intersections are listed for every cross-way until the next turn instruction.

**Properties**

- `location`: A `[longitude, latitude]` pair describing the location of the turn.
- `bearings`: A list of bearing values (e.g. [0,90,180,270]) that are available at the intersection. The bearings describe all available roads at the intersection.  Values are between 0-359 (0=true north)
- `classes`: An array of strings signifying the classes (as specified in the profile) of the road exiting the intersection.
- `entry`: A list of entry flags, corresponding in a 1:1 relationship to the bearings. A value of `true` indicates that the respective road could be entered on a valid route.
  `false` indicates that the turn onto the respective road would violate a restriction.
- `in`: index into bearings/entry array. Used to calculate the bearing just before the turn. Namely, the clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver/passing the intersection. Bearings are given relative to the intersection. To get the bearing
  in the direction of driving, the bearing has to be rotated by a value of 180. The value is not supplied for `depart` maneuvers.
- `out`: index into the bearings/entry array. Used to extract the bearing just after the turn. Namely, The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver/passing the intersection. The value is not supplied for `arrive` maneuvers.
- `lanes`: Array of `Lane` objects that denote the available turn lanes at the intersection. If no lane information is available for an intersection, the `lanes` property will not be present.

#### Example

```json
{
    "location":[13.394718,52.543096],
    "in":0,
    "out":2,
    "bearings":[60,150,240,330],
    "entry":["false","true","true","true"],
    "classes": ["toll", "restricted"],
    "lanes":{
        "indications": ["left", "straight"],
        "valid": false
    }
}
```

### Waypoint object

Object used to describe waypoint on a route.

**Properties**

- `name` Name of the street the coordinate snapped to
- `location` Array that contains the `[longitude, latitude]` pair of the snapped coordinate
- `distance` The distance, in metres, from the input coordinate to the snapped coordinate
- `hint` Unique internal identifier of the segment (ephemeral, not constant over data updates)
   This can be used on subsequent request to significantly speed up the query and to connect multiple services.
   E.g. you can use the `hint` value obtained by the `nearest` query as `hint` values for `route` inputs.

#### Example

```json
{
   "hint" : "KSoKADRYroqUBAEAEAAAABkAAAAGAAAAAAAAABhnCQCLtwAA_0vMAKlYIQM8TMwArVghAwEAAQH1a66g",
   "distance" : 4.152629,
   "name" : "Friedrichstraße",
   "location" : [
      13.388799,
      52.517033
   ]
}
```

## Flatbuffers format

Default response format is `json`, but OSRM supports binary [`flatbuffers`](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) format, which 
is much faster in serialization/deserialization, comparing to `json`.

The format itself is described in message descriptors, located at `include/engine/api/flatbuffers directory`. Those descriptors could
be compiled to provide protocol parsers in Go/Javascript/Typescript/Java/Dart/C#/Python/Lobster/Lua/Rust/PHP/Kotlin. Precompiled 
protocol parser for C++ is supplied with OSRM.

`Flatbuffers` format provides exactly same data, as `json` format with a slightly different layout, which was optimized to minimize
in-transfer size.

### Root object

Root object is the only object, available from a 'raw' `flatbuffers` buffer. It can be constructed with a following call:

         auto osrm = osrm::engine::api::fbresult::GetFBResult(some_input_buffer);

**Properties**

- `error`: `bool` Marks response as erroneous. Erroneus response should include `code` field set, all the other field may not present. 
- `code`: `Error` Error description object, only present, when `error` is `true`
- `waypoints`: `[Waypoint]` Array of `Waypoint` objects. Should present for every service call, unless `skip_waypoints` is set to `true`. Table service will put `sources` array here.
- `routes`: `[RouteObject]` Array of `RouteObject` objects. May be empty or absent. Should present for Route/Trip/Match services call.
- `table`: `Table` Table object, may absent. Should be present in case of Table service call.

### Error object

Contains error information.

**Properties**

- `code`: `string` Error code 
- `message`: `string` Detailed error message

### Waypoint object

Almost same as `json` Waypoint object. The following properties differ:

- `location`: `Position` Same as `json` location field, but different format. 
- `nodes`: `Uint64Pair` Same as `json` nodes field, but different format.

### RouteObject object

Almost same as `json` Route object. The following properties differ:

- `polyline`: `string` Same as `json` geometry.polyline or geometry.polyline6 fields. One field for both formats. 
- `coordinates`: `[Position]` Same as `json` geometry.coordinates field, but different format.
- `legs`: `[Leg]` Array of `Leg` objects.

### Leg object

Almost same as `json` Leg object. The following properties differ:

- `annotations`: `Annotation` Same as `json` annotation field, but different format.
- `steps`: `[Step]` Same as `step` annotation field, but different format.

### Step object

Almost same as `json` Step object. The following properties differ:

- `polyline`: `string` Same as `json` geometry.polyline or geometry.polyline6 fields. One field for both formats. 
- `coordinates`: `[Position]` Same as `json` geometry.coordinates field, but different format.
- `maneuver`: `StepManeuver` Same as `json` maneuver field, but different format.

| `NewName`        | no turn is taken/possible, but the road name changes. The road can take a turn itself, following `modifier`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Depart`         | indicates the departure of the leg                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `Roundabout`     | traverse roundabout, if the route leaves the roundabout there will be an additional property `exit` for exit counting. The modifier specifies the direction of entering the roundabout.                                                                                                                                      |
| `Rotary`         | a traffic circle. While very similar to a larger version of a roundabout, it does not necessarily follow roundabout rules for right of way.

| `Rotary`         | a traffic circle. While very similar to a larger version of a roundabout, it does not necessarily follow roundabout rules for right of way. It can offer `rotary_name` and/or `rotary_pronunciation` parameters (located in the RouteStep object) in addition to the `exit` parameter (located on the StepManeuver object).  |
| `RoundaboutTurn` | Describes a turn at a small roundabout that should be treated as normal turn. The `modifier` indicates the turn direciton. Example instruction: `At the roundabout turn left`. |
| `Notification`   | not an actual turn but a change in the driving conditions. For example the travel mode or classes. If the road takes a turn itself, the `modifier` describes the direction |

### Annotation object

Exactly same as `json` annotation object. 


### Position object

A point on Earth. 

***Properties***
- `longitute`: `float` Point's longitude
- `latitude`: `float` Point's latitude

### Uint64Pair

A pair of long long integers. Used only by `Waypoint` object.

***Properties***
- `first`: `uint64` First pair value.
- `second`: `uint64` Second pair value.

### Table object

Almost same as `json` Table object. The main difference is that 'sources' field is absent and root's object 'waypoints' field is
used instead. All the other differences follow:

- `durations`: `[float]` Flat representation of a durations matrix. Element at row;col can be adressed as [row * cols + col]
- `distances`: `[float]` Flat representation of a destinations matrix. Element at row;col can be adressed as [row * cols + col]
- `destinations`: `[Waypoint]` Array of `Waypoint` objects. Will be `null` if `skip_waypoints` will be set to `true`
- `rows`: `ushort` Number of rows in durations/destinations matrices.
- `cols`: `ushort` Number of cols in durations/destinations matrices.
