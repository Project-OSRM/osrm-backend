# OSRM profiles
OSRM supports "profiles". Profiles representing routing behavior for different transport modes like car, bike and foot. You can also create profiles for variations like a fastest/shortest car profile or fastest/safest/greenest bicycles profile.

 A profile describes whether or not it's possible to route along a particular type of way, whether we can pass a particular node, and  how quickly we'll be traveling when we do. This feeds into the way the routing graph is created and thus influences the output routes.

## Available profiles
Out-of-the-box OSRM comes with profiles for car, bicycle and foot. You can easily modify these or create new ones if you like.

Profiles have a 'lua' extension, and are placed in 'profiles' directory.

When running OSRM preprocessing commands you specify the profile with the --profile (or the shorthand -p) option, for example:

`osrm-extract --profile ../profiles/car.lua planet-latest.osm.pbf`

## Processing flow
It's important to understand that profiles are used when preprocessing the OSM data, NOT at query time when routes are computed.

This means that after modifying a profile **you will need to extract, contract and reload the data again** and to see changes in the routing results. See [Processing Flow](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Processing-Flow) for more.

## Profiles are written in Lua
Profiles are not just configuration files. They are scripts written in the [Lua scripting language](http://www.lua.org). The reason for this is that OpenStreetMap data is complex, and it's not possible to simply define tag mappings. Lua scripting offers a powerful way to handle all the possible tag combinations found in OpenStreetMap nodes and ways.

## Basic structure of profiles
A profile will process every node and way in the OSM input data to determine what ways are routable in which direction, at what speed, etc.

A profile will typically:

- Define api version (required)
- Require library files (optional)
- Define setup function (required)
- Define process functions (some are required)
- Return functions table (required)

A profile can also define various local functions it needs.

Looking at [car.lua](../profiles/car.lua) as an example, at the top of the file the api version is defined and then required library files are included.

Then follows the `setup` function, which is called once when the profile is loaded. It returns a big hash table of configurations, specifying things like what speed to use for different way types. The configurations are used later in the various processing functions. Many adjustments can be done just by modifying this configuration table.

The setup function is also where you can do other setup, like loading an elevation data source if you want to consider that when processing ways.

Then come the `process_node` and `process_way` functions, which are called for each OSM node and way when extracting OpenStreetMap data with `osrm-extract`.

The `process_turn` function processes every possible turn in the network, and sets a penalty depending on the angle and turn of the movement.

Profiles can also define a `process_segment` function to handle differences in speed along an OSM way, for example to handle elevation. As you can see, this is not currently used in the car profile.

At the end of the file, a table is returned with references to the setup and processing functions the profile has defined.

## Understanding speed, weight and rate
When computing a route from A to B there can be different measures of what is the best route. That's why there's a need for different profiles.

Because speeds vary on different types of roads, the shortest and the fastest route are typically different. But there are many other possible preferences. For example a user might prefer a bicycle route that follow parks or other green areas, even though both duration and distance are a bit longer.

To handle this, OSRM doesn't simply choose the ways with the highest speed. Instead it uses the concepts of `weight` and `rate`. The rate is an abstract measure that you can assign to ways as you like to make some ways preferable to others. Routing will prefer ways with high rate.

The weight of a way is normally computed as length / rate. The weight can be thought of as the resistance or cost when passing the way. Routing will prefer ways with low weight.

You can also set the weight of a way to a fixed value. In this case it's not calculated based on the length or rate, and the rate is ignored.

You should set the speed to your best estimate of the actual speed that will be used on a particular way. This will result in the best estimated travel times.

If you want to prefer certain ways due to other factors than the speed, adjust the rate accordingly. If you adjust the speed, the time estimation will be skewed.

If you set the same rate on all ways, the result will be shortest path routing.
If you set rate = speed on all ways, the result will be fastest path routing.
If you want to prioritize certain streets, increase the rate on these.

## Elements
### api_version
A profile should set `api_version` at the top of your profile. This is done to ensure that older profiles are still supported when the api changes. If `api_version` is not defined, 0 will be assumed. The current api version is 4.

### Library files
The folder [profiles/lib/](../profiles/lib/) contains LUA library files for handling many common processing tasks.

File              | Notes
------------------|------------------------------
way_handlers.lua  | Functions for processing way tags
tags.lua          | Functions for general parsing of OSM tags
set.lua           | Defines the Set helper for handling sets of values
sequence.lua      | Defines the Sequence helper for handling sequences of values
access.lua        | Function for finding relevant access tags
destination.lua   | Function for finding relevant destination tags
maxspeed.lua      | Function for determining maximum speed
guidance.lua      | Function for processing guidance attributes

They all return a table of functions when you use `require` to load them. You can either store this table and reference its functions later, or if you need only a single function you can store that directly.

### setup()
The `setup` function is called once when the profile is loaded and must return a table of configurations. It's also where you can do other global setup, like loading data sources that are used during processing.

Note that processing of data is parallelized and several unconnected LUA interpreters will be running at the same time. The `setup` function will be called once for each. Each LUA interpreter will have its own set of globals.

The following global properties can be set under `properties` in the hash you return in the `setup` function:

Attribute                            | Type     | Notes
-------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
weight_name                          | String   | Name used in output for the routing weight property (default `'duration'`)
weight_precision                     | Unsigned | Decimal precision of edge weights (default `1`)
left_hand_driving                    | Boolean  | Are vehicles assumed to drive on the left? (used in guidance, default `false`)
use_turn_restrictions                | Boolean  | Are turn restrictions followed? (default `false`)
continue_straight_at_waypoint        | Boolean  | Must the route continue straight on at a via point, or are U-turns allowed? (default `true`)
max_speed_for_map_matching           | Float    | Maximum vehicle speed to be assumed in matching (in m/s)
max_turn_weight                      | Float    | Maximum turn penalty weight
force_split_edges                    | Boolean  | True value forces a split of forward and backward edges of extracted ways and guarantees that `process_segment` will be called for all segments (default `false`)


The following additional global properties can be set in the hash you return in the `setup` function:

Attribute                            | Type             | Notes
-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
excludable                           | Sequence of Sets | Determines which class-combinations are supported by the `exclude` option at query time. E.g. `Sequence{Set{"ferry", "motorway"}, Set{"motorway"}}` will allow you to exclude ferries and motorways, or only motorways.
classes                              | Sequence         | Determines the allowed classes that can be referenced using `{forward,backward}_classes` on the way in the `process_way` function.
restrictions                         | Sequence         | Determines which turn restrictions will be used for this profile.
suffix_list                          | Set              | List of name suffixes needed for determining if "Highway 101 NW" the same road as "Highway 101 ES".
relation_types                       | Sequence         | Determines wich relations should be cached for processing in this profile. It contains relations types

### process_node(profile, node, result, relations)
Process an OSM node to determine whether this node is a barrier or can be passed and whether passing it incurs a delay.

Argument | Description
---------|-------------------------------------------------------
profile  | The configuration table you returned in `setup`.
node     | The input node to process (read-only).
result   | The output that you will modify.
relations| Storage of relations to access relations, where `node` is a member.

The following attributes can be set on `result`:

Attribute       | Type    | Notes
----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------
barrier         | Boolean | Is it an impassable barrier?
traffic_lights  | Boolean | Is it a traffic light (incurs delay in `process_turn`)?

### process_way(profile, way, result, relations)
Given an OpenStreetMap way, the `process_way` function will either return nothing (meaning we are not going to route over this way at all), or it will set up a result hash.

Argument | Description
---------|-------------------------------------------------------
profile  | The configuration table you returned in `setup`.
way      | The input way to process (read-only).
result   | The output that you will modify.
relations| Storage of relations to access relations, where `way` is a member.

Importantly it will set `result.forward_mode` and `result.backward_mode` to indicate the travel mode in each direction, as well as set `result.forward_speed` and `result.backward_speed` to integer values representing the speed for traversing the way.

It will also set a number of other attributes on `result`.

Using the power of the scripting language you wouldn't typically see something as simple as a `result.forward_speed = 20` line within the `process_way` function. Instead `process_way` will examine the tag set on the way, process this information in various ways, calling other local functions and referencing the configuration in `profile`, etc., before arriving at the result.

The following attributes can be set on the result in `process_way`:

Attribute                               | Type     | Notes

is_startpoint                           | Boolean  | Can a journey start on this way? (e.g. ferry; if `false`, prevents snapping the start point to this way)
roundabout                              | Boolean  | Is this part of a roundabout?

### process_segment(profile, segment)
The `process_segment` function is called for every segment of OSM ways. A segment is a straight line between two OSM nodes.

On OpenStreetMap way cannot have different tags on different parts of a way. Instead you would split the way into several smaller ways. However many ways are long. For example, many ways pass hills without any change in tags.

Processing each segment of an OSM way makes it possible to have different speeds on different parts of a way based on external data like data about elevation, pollution, noise or scenic value and adjust weight and duration of the segment accordingly.

In the `process_segment` function you don't have access to OSM tags. Instead you use the geographical location of the start and end point of the way to look up information from another data source, like elevation data. See [rasterbot.lua](../profiles/rasterbot.lua) for an example.

The following attributes can be read and set on the result in `process_segment`:

Attribute          | Read/write? | Type    | Notes
-------------------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------
source.lon         | Read        | Float   | Co-ordinates of segment start

weight             | Read/write  | Float   | Routing weight for this segment
duration           | Read/write  | Float   | Duration for this segment

### process_turn(profile, turn)
The `process_turn` function is called for every possible turn in the network. Based on the angle and type of turn you assign the weight and duration of the movement.

The following attributes can be read and set on the result in `process_turn`:

#### `roads_on_the_right` and `roads_on_the_left`

The information of `roads_on_the_right` and `roads_on_the_left` that can be read are as follows:

Attribute                   | Read/write?   | Type      | Notes
---------------------       | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------
is_restricted               | Read          | Boolean   | Is it a restricted access road? (See definition in `process_way`)
mode                        | Read          | Enum      | Travel mode before the turn. Defined in `include/extractor/travel_mode.hpp`
is_motorway                 | Read          | Boolean   | Is the road a motorway?
is_link                     | Read          | Boolean   | Is the road a link?
number_of_lanes             | Read          | Integer   | How many lanes does the road have? (default when not tagged: 0)
highway_turn_classification | Read          | Integer   | Classification based on highway tag defined by user during setup. (default when not set: 0, allowed classification values are: 0-15)
access_turn_classification  | Read          | Integer   | Classification based on access tag defined by user during setup. (default when not set: 0, allowed classification values are: 0-15)
speed                       | Read          | Integer   | Speed on this road in km/h
priority_class              | Read          | Enum      | The type of road priority class of the leg. Defined in `include/extractor/road_classification.hpp`
is_incoming                 | Read          | Boolean   | Is the road an incoming road of the intersection
is_outgoing                 | Read          | Boolean   | Is the road an outgoing road of the intersection

The order of the roads in `roads_on_the_right` and `roads_on_the_left` are *counter clockwise*. If the turn is a u turn, all other connected roads will be in `roads_on_the_right`.

**Example**

```
           c   e
           |  /
           | /
    a ---- x ---- b
          /|
         / |
        f  d


```
When turning from `a` to `b` via `x`,
* `roads_on_the_right[1]` is the road `xf`
* `roads_on_the_right[2]` is the road `xd`
* `roads_on_the_left[1]` is the road `xe`
* `roads_on_the_left[2]` is the road `xc`

Note that indices of arrays in lua are 1-based.

#### `highway_turn_classification` and `access_turn_classification`
When setting appropriate turn weights and duration, information about the highway and access tags of roads that are involved in the turn are necessary. The lua turn function `process_turn` does not have access to the original osrm tags anymore. However, `highway_turn_classification` and `access_turn_classification` can be set during setup. The classification set during setup can be later used in `process_turn`.

**Example**

In the following example we use `highway_turn_classification` to set the turn weight to `10` if the turn is on a highway and to `5` if the turn is on a primary.

```
function setup()
  return {
    highway_turn_classification = {
      ['motorway'] = 2,
      ['primary'] = 1
    }
  }
end

function process_turn(profile, turn) {
  if turn.source_highway_turn_classification == 2 and turn.target_highway_turn_classification == 2 then
    turn.weight = 10

## Guidance
The guidance parameters in profiles are currently a work in progress. They can and will change.
Please be aware of this when using guidance configuration possibilities.

Guidance uses road classes to decide on when/if to emit specific instructions and to discover which road is obvious when following a route.
Classification uses three flags and a priority-category.
The flags indicate whether a road is a motorway (required for on/off ramps), a link type (the ramps itself, if also a motorway) and whether a road may be omitted in considerations (is considered purely for connectivity).
The priority-category influences the decision which road is considered the obvious choice and which roads can be seen as fork.
Forks can be emitted between roads of similar priority category only. Obvious choices follow a major priority road, if the priority difference is large.

### Using raster data
OSRM has built-in support for loading an interpolating raster data in ASCII format. This can be used e.g. for factoring in elevation when computing routes.

Use `raster:load()` in your `setup` function to load data and store the source in your configuration hash:

```lua
function setup()
  return {
    raster_source = raster:load(
      "rastersource.asc",  -- file to load
      0,    -- longitude min
      0.1,  -- longitude max
      0,    -- latitude min
      0.1,  -- latitude max
      5,    -- number of rows
      4     -- number of columns
    )
  }
end
```

The input data must an ASCII file with rows of integers. e.g.:

```
0  0  0   0
0  0  0   250
0  0  250 500
0  0  0   250
0  0  0   0
```

In your `segment_function` you can then access the raster source and use `raster:query()` to query to find the nearest data point, or `raster:interpolate()` to interpolate a value based on nearby data points.

You must check whether the result is valid before use it.

Example:

```lua
function process_segment (profile, segment)
  local sourceData = raster:query(profile.raster_source, segment.source.lon, segment.source.lat)
  local targetData = raster:query(profile.raster_source, segment.target.lon, segment.target.lat)

  local invalid = sourceData.invalid_data()
  if sourceData.datum ~= invalid and targetData.datum ~= invalid then
      -- use values to adjust weight and duration
    [...]
end
```

See [rasterbot.lua](../profiles/rasterbot.lua) and [rasterbotinterp.lua](../profiles/rasterbotinterp.lua) for examples.

### Helper functions
There are a few helper functions defined in the global scope that profiles can use:

- `durationIsValid`
- `parseDuration`
- `trimLaneString`
- `applyAccessTokens`
- `canonicalizeStringList`
