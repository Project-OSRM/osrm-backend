/**
 * The restriction graph is used to represent all possible restrictions within the routing graph.
 * The graph uses an edge-based node representation. Each node represents a compressed
 * node-based edge along a restriction path.
 *
 * Given a list of turn restrictions, the graph is created in multiple steps.
 *
 * INPUT
 * a -> b -> d: no_e
 * a -> b -> c: only_d
 * b -> c -> d: only_f
 * b -> c: no_g
 * e -> b -> d: no_g
 *
 * Step 1: create a disjoint union of prefix trees for all restriction paths.
 * The restriction instructions are added to the final node in its path.
 *
 * STEP 1
 * (a,b) -> (b,d,[no_e])
 *      \->(b,c,[only_d])
 *
 * (b,c,[no_g]) -> (c,d,[only_f])
 * (e,b) -> (b,d,[no_g])
 *
 * Step 2: add transfers between restriction paths that overlap.
 * We do this by traversing each restriction path, tracking where the suffix of our current path
 * matches the prefix of any other. If it does, there's opportunity to transfer to the suffix
 * restriction path *if* the transfer would not be restricted *and* that edge does not take us
 * further on our current path. Nested restrictions are also added from any of the suffix paths.
 *
 * STEP 2
 * (a,b) -> (b,d,[no_e])
 *      \->(b,c,[only_d,no_g])
 *                \
 * (b,c,[no_g]) -> \-> (c,d,[only_f])
 *
 * (e,b) -> (b,d,[no_g])
 * If a transfer applies to multiple suffix paths, we only add the edge to the largest suffix path.
 * This ensures we correctly track all overlapping paths.
 *
 *
 * Step 3: The nodes are split into
 * start nodes - compressed edges that are entry points into a restriction path.
 * via nodes - compressed edges that are intermediate steps along a restriction path.
 * Start nodes and via nodes are indexed by the compressed node-based edge for easy retrieval
 *
 * STEP 3
 * Start Node Index
 * (a,b) => (a,b)
 * (b,c) => (b,c,[no_g])
 * (e,b) => (e,b)
 *
 * Via Nodes Index
 * (b,c) => (b,c,[only_d,no_g])
 * (b,d) => (b,d,[no_e]) , (b,d,[no_g])
 * (c,d) => (c,d,[only_f])
 *
 * Duplicate Nodes:
 * There is a 1-1 mapping between restriction graph via nodes and edge-based-graph duplicate nodes.
 * This relationship is used in the creation of restrictions in the routing edge-based graph.
