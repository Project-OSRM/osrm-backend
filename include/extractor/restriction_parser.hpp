/**
 * Parses the relations that represents turn restrictions.
 *
 * Currently only restrictions where the via objects is a node are supported.
 *  from   via   to
 * ------->(x)-------->
 *
 * While this class does not directly invoke any lua code _per relation_ it does
 * load configuration values from the profile, that are saved in variables.
 * Namely ```use_turn_restrictions``` and ```get_restrictions```.
 *
 * The restriction is represented by the osm id of the from way, the osm id of the
 * to way and the osm id of the via node. This representation must be post-processed
 * in the extractor to work with the edge-based data-model of OSRM:
 * Since the from and to way share the via-node a turn will have the following form:
 * ...----(a)-----(via)------(b)----...
 * So it can be represented by the tripe (a, via, b).
