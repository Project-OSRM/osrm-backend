/**
 * Configures an OSRM instance.
 *
 * You can customize the storage OSRM uses for auxiliary files specifying a storage config.
 *
 * You can further set service constraints.
 * These are the maximum number of allowed locations (-1 for unlimited) for the services:
 *  - Trip
 *  - Route
 *  - Table
 *  - Match
 *  - Nearest
 *
 * In addition, shared memory can be used for datasets loaded with osrm-datastore.
 *
 * You can chose between three algorithms:
 *  - Algorithm::CH
 *      Contraction Hierarchies, extremely fast queries but slow pre-processing. The default right
 * now.
 *  - Algorithm::CoreCH
 *      Deprecated, to be removed in v6.0
 *      Contraction Hierachies with partial contraction for faster pre-processing but slower
 * queries.
 *  - Algorithm::MLD
 *      Multi Level Dijkstra, moderately fast in both pre-processing and query.
 *
 * \see OSRM, StorageConfig
