    Background:
        Given the profile "testbot"

    Scenario: osrm-routed - Help should be shown when no options are passed
        When I run "osrm-routed"
        Then stderr should be empty
        And stdout should contain /osrm-routed(.exe)? <base.osrm> \[<options>\]:/
        And stdout should contain "Options:"
        And stdout should contain "--version"
        And stdout should contain "--help"

        And stdout should contain "--trial"

        And it should exit successfully
