Feature: Car - Turn restrictions
# Handle turn restrictions as defined by http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:restriction
# Note that if u-turns are allowed, turn restrictions can lead to suprising, but correct, routes.

    Background: Use car routing
        Given the profile "car"
        Given a grid size of 200 meters
