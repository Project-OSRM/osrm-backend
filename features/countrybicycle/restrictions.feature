Feature: Bike - Turn restrictions
# Ignore turn restrictions on bicycle, since you always become a temporary pedestrian.
# Note that if u-turns are allowed, turn restrictions can lead to suprising, but correct, routes.

    Background:
        Given the profile "countrybicycle"
        Given a grid size of 200 meters

    # check to see if bicycle profiles handle relations. The code path is the same as in cars.
    # If relations are passed, all variants tested in car also work for bike
