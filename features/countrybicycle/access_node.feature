Feature: Bike - Access tags on nodes
# Reference: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access

    Background:
        Given the profile "countrybicycle"

    Scenario: Bike - Access tag hierarchy on nodes
        Then routability should be
            | node/access | node/vehicle | node/bicycle | node/highway | bothw   |
            |             |              |              |              | cycling |

            | no          | yes          |              |              | cycling |

    Scenario: Bike - Overwriting implied acccess on nodes doesn't overwrite way
        Then routability should be
            | highway  | node/access | node/vehicle | node/bicycle | bothw   |
            | cycleway |             |              |              | cycling |

            | cycleway |             | no           |              |         |
